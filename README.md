# Forge VSCode Extension

This VSCode extension provides (a degree of) support for the Forge language. While formatted in terms of a language client and server, Forge does not have a language server. Rather, we invoke racket from the command line.

The extension provides the following features:

Syntax Highlighting
Logging
Error reporting
Toadus Ponens, a tool that analyzes student tests
